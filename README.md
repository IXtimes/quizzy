# quizzy
An AI-enhanced practice test application used to help prepare students with both rehearsed and newly generated questions for any subject domain, academic or otherwise.

NOTE: AI ENHANCED ELEMENTS REQUIRES A VALID OPENAI API KEY, YOU CAN GET ONE HERE: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
Please note that the application in no way requires an API key to use its basic features, so feel free to trial the software first before looking into getting a key to use it. If you decide to get a key, keep in mind that this software was designed to prompt as cheaply as possible, and throughout development I only spent about ~$0.20 on API calls making 2 study sets of over 150 questions each (~150 AI generated questions in total not including field calls)

I plan to release simple docs for the application that overviews some more niche features here when its done: https://github.com/IXtimes/quizzy.wiki.git (Heres a WIP)

I am done with this project aside from fixing some bugs here and there if they crop up. If this project picks up I might add a few remaining features but as of now that isn't planned. Feel free to fork if you want to make improvements yourself.
